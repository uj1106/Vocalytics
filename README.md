Vocalytics: AI-Powered Earnings Call Analysis
Project Relevance

Traditional financial analysis, focused on spreadsheets and transcripts, captures what was said but completely misses how it was said. A critical layer of human information is lost. Groundbreaking studies from leading business schools, including research from institutions like MIT Sloan and the University of Chicago Booth, have demonstrated that the non-verbal, paralinguistic cues in an executive's voice contain predictive signals about future firm performance, risk, and credibility.

This project bridges that gap. It systematically quantifies the human element of corporate disclosures, turning what was previously subjective "gut feeling" into a data-driven analytical edge.

How It Works

Vocalytics analyzes the vocal patterns of executives during corporate earnings calls to measure their real-time stress, confidence, and conviction. The methodology involves:

Establishing a Baseline: It first establishes a speaker's unique vocal baseline using their calm, scripted remarks at the start of the call.

Detecting Deviation: It then detects significant vocal deviations during the high-pressure, unscripted Q&A session.

Identifying Contradictions: The primary goal is to identify crucial contradictions between the positive language of a transcript and the underlying stress or lack of confidence revealed in the speaker's voice.

Potential Use Cases & Insights

An accurate analysis from this tool can be used to generate two primary types of insights:

Short-Term Trading Signals: By identifying moments of high stress or low confidence that the market may have missed, the model can help predict post-earnings stock drift. If management sounds unconvincing about their own positive guidance, it may signal an opportunity to bet against the market's initial reaction.

Long-Term Governance & Risk Assessment: By tracking management credibility and composure over multiple quarters, the tool can act as an early warning system. A consistent pattern of vocal stress around specific topics (e.g., competition, debt, a new product line) can reveal hidden, long-term strategic risks long before they are reflected in the financial statements.
